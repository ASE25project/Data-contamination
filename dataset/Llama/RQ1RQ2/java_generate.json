The method should check if the `imageDrawable` is not null, and if so, calculate and set the rotation pivot points `mRotationPivotX` and `mRotationPivotY` to be the center of the drawable by dividing its intrinsic width and height by 2, rounding the result to the nearest integer.

{"question": "Write a Java method named `enableFields` that takes an array of `Component` objects and a boolean value as parameters.

{"question": "Write a Java method that overrides a parent class's virtualize function. The method should take three parameters: an OVXSwitch object, a list of OFAction objects called approvedActions, and an OVXMatch object.

{"question": "Write a Java method named `writeObject` that overrides a parent class method. The method should take a `BufferOutput` object and a `Serializer` object as parameters.
